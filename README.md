# Hopscotch-1
So A Clone of Hopscotch

Tried to add as many features as I could. I will very soon implement my `exec` function that I created.

Projects are not runnable yet. That's the easy part, though. The hard part was making this UI.

Features:
- run small programs (i.e. print)
- simple data types: bool, int, float, string, arrays\<T>, dictionary<T,U>, range\<T>, set\<T>
- variables
- if, else, elif
- for loops, while loops, repeat n times
- continue, break
- fuctions, parameters, return types
- structs, classes, enums, enum cases
- attributes, static variables, static functions, initializers
- persisting variables: use "store" instead of "var"
